A program that compares and contrasts the top 25 colleges and universities in the United States according 
to US News Rankings. It will compare pricing, campus, location, majors, alumni, social life, etc. You will 
also be able to input high school GPA, extracurriculars, SAT score, PSAT scores, awards, jobs, course load, i
deal major, gender, ethnicity, etc. and it will calculate your chances of getting into the colleges based on 
acceptance rate and current students stats. It would access an excel spreadsheet that contains all the stats 
for the colleges and universities within the program. For the division of labor, there will be one person making 
the excel spreadsheet and connecting to the program, one person formatting whats being printed out, and one person 
who does the coding for the calculations on chances of getting in based on users input.
