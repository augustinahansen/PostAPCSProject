# Skribbl.io but java

## Proposed by Ethan Hu, Sonja Larson, Catherine Liu

Multiple user game. One user will start out drawing on a blank canvas based on a given random word generated by the computer (displayed on their screen). The drawing will then be displayed to the other users to guess the word that the drawing was based on. Other users then enter their answer into an answer box, whoever gets the correct word in the given time gets a point.

- Take turns drawing until each user has drawn 3 times
- Points calculated at by the end of the round
- System will rank the users based on points, awarding the top 3 players
- Graphic at the end to display ranking

- A real-time updating screen is ideal, displaying what the user is drawing to everyone else while the drawing is still in progress
- We can have a timer graphic as well counting down the time if it is possible to have a real-time updating screen and display words that people are guessing so that they can be inspired by each other as long as it is not the correct answer because then everyone will copy each other like in the real skribbl.io game
